# ASA Save Inspector
ASA Save Inspector (ASI) is an ARK Survival Ascended save file analyzer.

ASI uses [ArkParse](https://github.com/VincentHenauGithub/ark-save-parser) to extract data from the save file, and provides a modern graphical user interface to analyze the data.

This application is still under development, more features will be added in the future.

## Features
- View, search, filter and sort the various game objects (dinos, items, structures and so on).
- Visualize game objects on a map (double clicking on a map marker will select the associated game object in the app's main window).
- Quickly export some game objects to JSON (using right click on the game object lines).
