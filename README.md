# ASA Save Inspector
ASA Save Inspector (ASI) is an ARK Survival Ascended save file analyzer.

ASI uses [ArkParse](https://github.com/VincentHenauGithub/ark-save-parser) to extract data from the save file, and provides a modern graphical user interface to analyze the data.

Note: This application is still under development, more features will be added in the future.
